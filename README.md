# Authentication server

This project is a OAuth2 server coded in .NET 9 and the library OpenIddict

To mount this project, use a postgresql database and run the first migration

The seed data folder is empty because I'll be using the first data for my own things so make
sure you create some ef core IEntityTypeConfiguration to seed the database the right way before
you run your first migration.

Please raise an issue if there's a problem and I might accept some pull request.

If you're ready to fork the project, I guess you're already familiar with .NET so the instructions
are unnecessary.
